                indicate that something is fundamentally wrong with the MachineTemplate's
                spec or the configuration of the machine controller, and that manual
                intervention is required. Examples of terminal errors would be invalid
                combinations of settings in the spec, values that are unsupported
                by the machine controller, or the responsible machine controller itself
                being critically misconfigured.  Any transient errors that occur during
                the reconciliation of Machines can be added as events to the MachineSet
                object and/or logged in the controller's output.
